# Automated recognition of moralization in written text
Automated identification of text structures related to moralization.

**_This project is currently under development!_**

Based on an annotated corpus, the automatic classification of moralization constructs in written text will be investigated.

The ability to identify different categories will be investigated:
1. Moral values
1. Acting entities
1. Communicative role
1. Consequence

The developed software will work with annotations from [INCEpTION](https://inception-project.github.io/).
